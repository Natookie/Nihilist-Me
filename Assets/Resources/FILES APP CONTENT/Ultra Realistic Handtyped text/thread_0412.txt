I’m saving this one because it’s the first time I noticed the shift.

They started with:
“Why are you still talking about this? It was months ago.”

I replied that time doesn’t change facts.
They said facts don’t matter when people feel unsafe.

I asked them to explain how feelings rewrite events.
They said I was being manipulative.

So I asked them to point to the manipulation.
They said my tone.

I quoted my own message and asked what part of it was hostile.
They stopped answering that question and started describing me instead.

At that point I realized something important:
They weren’t arguing with what I said.
They were arguing with the idea that I wouldn’t submit.

Other people jumped in.
Someone said I was “exactly the type.”
I asked what type meant.
They said “you know.”

I didn’t.

They kept repeating it.
I kept asking for clarification.
Eventually someone told me to stop playing dumb.

I wasn’t playing anything.

The thread ended when a moderator locked it for “bad faith.”
No one explained what that meant.
No one addressed the original claim.

I didn’t convince anyone.
But I wasn’t bent out of shape either.

That felt new.
