You probably don’t remember my face.

That’s the funny part.
I remember yours perfectly.

Your voice when you said “we have to consider how it looks.”
Your hands folded like you were being careful instead of lazy.
The way you nodded when everyone else nodded.

You didn’t decide anything.
You followed.

You let a room think for you.
You let volume become truth.
You let momentum do your job.

And you went home that night.
Ate dinner.
Slept.

I stayed here.

Do you know how much of your life is public?
Schedules.
Photos.
Little posts about “educating with empathy.”

You talk about responsibility like it’s abstract.
Like it doesn’t attach to anything.
Like it doesn’t leave fingerprints.

I used to think people like you were cruel.
That was giving you too much credit.

You were convenient.

I don’t need to touch you.
I don’t need to raise my voice.
I just need to remember.
And remind.

Every time something feels slightly off.
Every time a decision follows the crowd a little too easily.
Every time you wonder why a room suddenly feels quiet.

That’s me thinking about you.
