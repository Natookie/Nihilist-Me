I am writing this down because every time I explain it out loud,
people interrupt me or jump to conclusions.

On the night of the incident, I was walking back to the boys’ tents.
I heard laughter and whispering coming from the direction of the showers.
It didn’t sound normal. It didn’t sound like someone just passing by.

When I got closer, I saw several figures near the fence line.
I could tell they were holding phones because of the light.

I shouted at them to stop.

I did not cross the fence.
I did not approach the stalls.
I did not record anything.

They ran immediately.
