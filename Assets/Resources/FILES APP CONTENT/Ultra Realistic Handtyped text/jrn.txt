People keep asking why I don’t just log off.

They say arguing online is pointless.
They say I’m wasting my time.
They say I should focus on “real life.”

But this is the only place where things follow rules.

In real life, someone can look at you and decide what you are.
Online, at least for a moment, words have to line up.
Claims have to connect to something.
If they don’t, you can point at the gap.

I know it doesn’t change minds.
I’m not stupid.
I can see when people are already decided.

That’s not the point.

The point is that when I’m arguing,
I’m not waiting for permission to speak.
I’m not apologizing for existing.
I’m not guessing what expression I’m supposed to have.

I’m responding to what’s written.
Nothing else.

Maybe it looks cold.
Maybe it is.
But cold is stable.

And stability feels a lot like safety.
