didn’t sleep again

i stopped setting alarms because there’s nowhere to go
mom still knocks anyway
soft at first
then harder if i don’t answer
like she’s checking if i still exist

the shower lights keep coming back
not the people
just the lights
too bright
like there was no place to stand without being obvious

i keep thinking how stupid it was to yell
not because it was wrong
just because it assumed someone would listen

school keeps emailing
“checking in”
“hope you’re doing well”
they don’t ask when i’m coming back anymore
just whether i’m okay
which feels worse somehow

dad comes home late
later than before
we don’t talk about it
he asks if i ate
i say yes even when i didn’t
it keeps things simple

i sleep during the day now
or i lie there and scroll
or i read the same paragraph over and over
sometimes i realize i’ve been staring at nothing for a while

i tried studying at first
told myself i’d keep up
that lasted maybe a week
every assignment felt fake
like i was pretending my life still had a shape

people stopped messaging one by one
not all at once
just slower replies
then none
no goodbye
just quiet again

i went outside once last week
stood there for a minute
felt like i was doing something illegal
came back in

mom asked if i wanted to talk
i said “later”
she said “okay”
we both knew that meant never

the lights come back when it’s quiet
not flashing
just there
unchanging

i don’t think about the future anymore
i think about getting through the day
then the next one
like stacking something fragile
trying not to look too far ahead

it’s weird
nothing is happening
but it feels like everything already ended
