SECTION I — WHAT FUCKING HAPPENED
────────────────────────────────────────

It was late enough that most people were already back in their tents.
Not quiet, but that tired kind of noisy where everything sounds farther away.
I remember thinking the air felt damp, like it always does after everyone showers.

I was heading back toward the boys’ tents.
There’s a dirt path that cuts past the shower area — not inside it, not hidden,
just the shortest way back. Everyone used it. I’d used it all week.

That’s when I heard laughing.
Not normal laughing. The kind that stops when it thinks it’s being noticed.

At first I ignored it.
I remember hesitating, actually.
I told myself it wasn’t my problem.
Then I heard the sound of water and whispering again,
and I saw light flicker where it shouldn’t have.

Phone screens.

There were at least three figures.
I know this because the lights weren’t moving together.
They were crouched low, near the fence line,
angled toward the girls’ shower building.

I froze.
I didn’t think.
I didn’t plan.
I yelled.

I don’t even remember the exact words.
Something like “Hey” or “What are you doing.”
It came out louder than I expected.

They scattered immediately.
One bolted toward the trees.
Another ran back toward the tents.
I remember one of them almost slipping.

I stayed where I was.
That part matters to me.
I didn’t chase.
I didn’t run.

A few minutes later, Mr. K showed up.
Not because she saw anything, someone else must’ve gone to get him.
He asked what was going on.
Before I could finish a sentence, Ryan and Joel were already talking.
Marcus nodded along behind them.

They said they saw me near the showers.
They said I was alone.
Then later they said I ran.
Then later they said I stayed too long.

Ms. Eliza arrived after.
She didn’t ask me what I saw.
She asked why I was there.

When I tried to explain, she kept stopping me.
Saying things like “we understand” before I finished.
She said it was serious.
She said “we have to be careful.”

Careful of what, she never said.

No one asked why I yelled.
No one asked who ran.
No one asked why three different stories somehow pointed to the same person.

By morning, it wasn’t a question anymore.
It was already a version.

SECTION II — COMFORT
────────────────────────

I keep thinking about how normal everything was before.

Aira and I used to sit on the steps outside the cafeteria after lunch.
Not talking about anything important.
Just complaining about food or teachers or how stupid uniforms looked.

She laughed with her whole face.
Like she forgot to stop herself.

On the trip, we stayed up late the first night,
sitting near the tents with our backs against our bags.
She told me about how she wanted to leave town someday.
I said I’d probably stay.
She said someone had to remember the place.

We traded snacks.
She always stole the good ones.
I pretended to be annoyed.

The day before everything happened,
we walked back together after activities.
She was tired and leaned into my shoulder for a second.
Just a second.
I remember thinking my chest felt too loud.

Nothing big.
Nothing dramatic.
Just easy.

That’s the part I keep coming back to.
Not the shouting.
Not the lights.

The quiet parts.
The version of me that existed when someone knew my name
and didn’t attach anything else to it.

I don’t think about the trip anymore as a whole.
I think about it as two separate lives.

One where I was just there.
And one where I wasn’t allowed to be anymore.
