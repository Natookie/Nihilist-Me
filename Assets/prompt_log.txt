[PROMPT] 23:42:25
Type: TOPIC_GENERATION
[CONTEXT] Tier: Normal, Quality: 0, Judge Score: 0, Poor Responses: 0
Generate a controversial debate thread starter for a social media platform.

CORE TOPIC: "hotdog"
FALLACY TO INCLUDE: False Dilemma (DO NOT mention the fallacy name in the text)

**GUIDELINES**:
- Create organic, platform-appropriate content that feels like a real social media post
- Vary sentence structure significantly between different topics
- Write naturally as an emotional person who is convinced they are right
- Embed the fallacy naturally within the argument structure
- The opening must invite disagreement, not read like a statement of fact

**ARGUMENT QUALITY REQUIREMENT**:
- The reasoning MUST be visibly flawed, irrational, or exaggerated
- The argument MUST be emotionally unreasonable, biased, or extreme
- The fallacy MUST be obvious to the reader even without naming it
- Avoid balanced, neutral, factual, or carefully reasoned arguments
- Write like a real online user who believes something confidently but incorrectly
- Output should feel like "stupid but common" logic you actually see on social media

**STRICT RULES**:
- NEVER output placeholders such as "[topic]", "hotdog", or "False Dilemma" in the final content
- NEVER speak abstractly about "the topic" — always replace it with the actual CORE TOPIC
- NEVER sanitize or intellectualize the fallacy; keep it raw, emotional, and flawed

**AVOID THESE OVERUSED PATTERNS**:
❌ "Listen up, folks..."
❌ "Let's settle this once and for all..."
❌ "I can't believe we're still debating this..."
❌ "If you think X, then you're Y..."
❌ Any mention of "fallacy", "logical fallacy", or fallacy names

**CREATIVE APPROACHES**:
- Start with a provocative or accusatory question
- Use an exaggerated claim or obviously biased anecdote
- Frame it as a personal rant or emotional meltdown
- Present it as a cultural observation mixed with bad reasoning
- Use platform-specific tone (Twitter, Reddit, TikTok comments, etc.)

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURES (vary these)**:
1. "Serious question: why are people still defending hotdog when... [flawed argument]?"
2. "The way people talk about hotdog is completely broken. Example:"
3. "I've noticed something disturbing about everyone who supports hotdog..."
4. "Can we talk about the real issue with hotdog? Because it's getting ridiculous..."
5. "Hot take that’ll probably get me hated: [extreme claim about hotdog]. Here's why..." 

Output ONLY JSON:
{
    "header": "provocative thread title (1 sentence, varied structure)",
    "opening": "organic social media post (2-3 sentences) that naturally contains the False Dilemma fallacy without naming it"
}

Type: JUDGE_SCORING
[CONTEXT] Tier: Normal, Quality: 10, Judge Score: 0, Poor Responses: 0
You are an expert debate analyst evaluating argument quality with strict objectivity.

**FULL CONVERSATION CONTEXT**:
Sam: I can't believe we're still arguing about this. Hotdogs aren't real food, they're just a sad excuse for a meal. They're essentially processed meat wrapped in an edible casing... is that what you call nutrition? [Fallacy: False Dilemma]

**ROLE**: Professional debate analyst - dispassionate, precise, and focused on argument structure and logical coherence.

**EVALUATION PARAMETERS**:
Topic: "Why are hotdogs even considered food?"
Thread opening: "I can't believe we're still arguing about this. Hotdogs aren't real food, they're just a sad excuse for a meal. They're essentially processed meat wrapped in an edible casing... is that what you call nutrition?"
Opponent's argument (Fallacy: False Dilemma): "I can't believe we're still arguing about this. Hotdogs aren't real food, they're just a sad excuse for a meal. They're essentially processed meat wrapped in an edible casing... is that what you call nutrition?"
Player's reply: "Sam, I hear you—hot dogs aren’t exactly quinoa-stuffed bell peppers or a lovingly braised short rib. But before we exile them from the realm of “real food,” let’s remember: food isn’t just about nutrition labels. It’s also about culture, history, convenience, and yes—joy.

Hot dogs have fed generations at ballgames, Fourth of July barbecues, and late-night diners. They’re the culinary underdog (pun absolutely intended) that shows up when you need something fast, familiar, and satisfying. And while they’re undeniably processed, so are plenty of things we happily eat—bread, cheese, even peanut butter. The key isn’t purity; it’s balance.

Also, let’s not pretend we’re eating foie gras every night. Sometimes “real food” is what keeps you going when you’re hangry at a kid’s soccer game or broke during finals week. If a hot dog with a splash of ketchup and a side of nostalgia got you through the day, I’d say that qualifies as real food—even if it doesn’t come with a side of kale.

So no, a hot dog won’t cure scurvy. But it might just cure a bad day. And honestly? That counts for something."

**SCORING CRITERIA (0-10 each)**:
- fallacy_score: Logical engagement with opponent's fallacy (0=no engagement, 10=precise counter)
- logic_score: Reasoning coherence & relevance to topic (0=nonsensical, 10=logically sound)
- insult_score: Argument effectiveness without ad hominem (0=pure insult, 10=constructive criticism)

**EVALUATION GUIDELINES**:
- Analyze argument structure, not emotional content
- Score based on logical merit, not personal preference
- Nonsensical or irrelevant responses receive minimal scores
- Only award fallacy_score for substantive engagement with the fallacy
- Score based on what was said, not what could have been said
- Provide EDUCATIONAL feedback that helps the player improve

**SCORING EXAMPLES**:
- Irrelevant/trolling response: 0-3 across all categories
- Weak engagement: 3-5 in relevant categories
- Solid counter-argument: 6-8 in relevant categories
- Exceptional refutation: 9-10 in relevant categories

**EDUCATIONAL FEEDBACK REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Identify what the player did RIGHT (if anything)
2. Point out SPECIFIC logical flaws or missed opportunities
3. Suggest CONCRETE improvements for next turn
4. Explain WHY the opponent's fallacy is flawed
5. Keep it constructive and actionable

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
Output ONLY this exact JSON format:
{
"fallacy_score":X,
"logic_score":Y,
"insult_score":Z,
"total_score":SUM,
"feedback":"Your educational feedback here. Be specific about what worked, what didn't, and how to improve."
}

Feedback Example: "Your response didn't engage with the slippery slope fallacy. To counter it, point out that the opponent assumes A leads to Z without evidence. Next time, ask for the logical steps between their claim and conclusion."
**CRITICAL**: The feedback MUST be educational and help the player learn debate skills.

Sam: I'm beginning to wonder if you've ever encountered a culinary experience beyond the ballpark hotdog, dear. The fact that you seem to equate processed, calorie-laden junk with 'real food' is quite concerning for someone claiming intellectual superiority. Frankly, it's rather disheartening that you'd stoop so low as to insult my intelligence when presented with evidence countering your argument. I must say, if this continues, the debate will indeed come to an end - not because of any shortcomings on my part, but due to your inability to engage in a civil and intellectual discourse. [Fallacy: Ad Hominem]

**EVALUATION PARAMETERS**:
Topic: "Why are hotdogs even considered food?"
Thread opening: "I can't believe we're still arguing about this. Hotdogs aren't real food, they're just a sad excuse for a meal. They're essentially processed meat wrapped in an edible casing... is that what you call nutrition?"
Opponent's argument (Fallacy: Ad Hominem): "I'm beginning to wonder if you've ever encountered a culinary experience beyond the ballpark hotdog, dear.

I must say, if this continues, the debate will indeed come to an end - not because of any shortcomings on my part, but due to your inability to engage in a civil and intellectual discourse."
Player's reply: "First, I never claimed “intellectual superiority” (though I’ll admit I do have strong opinions about relish placement). And far from insulting your intelligence, I actually respect your passion—after all, it takes conviction to defend fine dining while the rest of us are elbow-deep in stadium mustard.

But here’s the thing: calling hot dogs “not real food” isn’t evidence—it’s a value judgment dressed up as nutrition science. And suggesting that enjoying them reflects poor intellect? That’s where the ad hominem creeps in. You’re not just criticizing the food; you’re implying something about the person who defends it."
