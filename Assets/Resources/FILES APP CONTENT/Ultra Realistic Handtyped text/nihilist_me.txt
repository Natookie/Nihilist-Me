I didn’t go looking for fallacies because I liked them.
I went looking because something felt wrong and I needed a reason that wasn’t “me.”

At first they were almost comforting.
There was a word for the thing that kept happening.
A pattern.
A shape.
It meant I wasn’t crazy for feeling like the ground shifted under me while everyone else acted normal.

But the more I learned them, the more they showed up.
Everywhere.
In jokes.
In lectures.
In casual conversations that weren’t even arguments.

Someone laughs instead of answering.
Someone says “everyone knows that.”
Someone changes what you said just enough that correcting it makes you sound defensive.

Once you see it, you can’t unsee it.
That’s the worst part.

I don’t walk into conversations anymore.
I scan them.
I listen for shortcuts.
I wait for the moment where the truth stops mattering and momentum takes over.

And when it happens, something in me tightens.
Because I know exactly where it leads.

People think fallacies are mistakes.
They’re not.
They’re tools.
They work because they feel good to use.
They save effort.
They save people from doubt.

That’s what makes them stupid.
Not that they’re wrong — but that they’re easy.
Anyone can use them.
You don’t have to think.
You don’t have to check.
You just lean on what already feels right.

They made my life miserable because they worked.
Because they let a room decide something without ever stopping.
Because they let silence count as agreement.
Because they let confidence replace care.

Sometimes I wish I never learned the names.
Then I could at least pretend conversations were about understanding again.

Now every time someone talks, I hear the gap.
And once you hear the gap, you can’t step around it.
You either point at it —
or you let it swallow you.

I don’t know how to do the second one anymore.
