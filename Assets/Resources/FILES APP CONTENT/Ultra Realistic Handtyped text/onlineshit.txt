I tried explaining online.

People didn’t read.
They quoted one sentence and ignored the rest.
They joked about it.
They kept asking why I was “defensive.”

Every explanation became proof to them.

I’m writing all of this because people keep saying I should just move on.

I can’t move on from something I didn’t do.
I can’t apologize for something that never happened.
And I can’t prove a negative to people who already decided.
