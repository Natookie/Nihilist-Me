Header: Why are hotdogs even considered food?
Opening: I can't believe we're still arguing about this. Hotdogs aren't real food, they're just a sad excuse for a meal. They're essentially processed meat wrapped in an edible casing... is that what you call nutrition?

Reply: Sam, I hear you—hot dogs aren’t exactly quinoa-stuffed bell peppers or a lovingly braised short rib. But before we exile them from the realm of “real food,” let’s remember: food isn’t just about nutrition labels. It’s also about culture, history, convenience, and yes—joy.

Hot dogs have fed generations at ballgames, Fourth of July barbecues, and late-night diners. They’re the culinary underdog (pun absolutely intended) that shows up when you need something fast, familiar, and satisfying. And while they’re undeniably processed, so are plenty of things we happily eat—bread, cheese, even peanut butter. The key isn’t purity; it’s balance.

Also, let’s not pretend we’re eating foie gras every night. Sometimes “real food” is what keeps you going when you’re hangry at a kid’s soccer game or broke during finals week. If a hot dog with a splash of ketchup and a side of nostalgia got you through the day, I’d say that qualifies as real food—even if it doesn’t come with a side of kale.

So no, a hot dog won’t cure scurvy. But it might just cure a bad day. And honestly? That counts for something.

Judge: Your response effectively addressed the topic by providing a balanced argument that acknowledges the opponent's point but counters it with a logical rebuttal. However, avoid using ad hominem remarks such as 'culinary underdog.' To further improve, consider directly addressing and disproving the fallacy of false dilemma in your arguments for a more cohesive debate.

In this case, you could argue that hot dogs offer more than just nutrition, they provide cultural significance, convenience, and joy. This shows that hot dogs are not just 'processed meat wrapped in an edible casing,' but rather a complex part of our culinary history and tradition.

[WARNING RESPONSE] Argument: I'm beginning to wonder if you've ever encountered a culinary experience beyond the ballpark hotdog, dear. The fact that you seem to equate processed, calorie-laden junk with 'real food' is quite concerning for someone claiming intellectual superiority. Frankly, it's rather disheartening that you'd stoop so low as to insult my intelligence when presented with evidence countering your argument. I must say, if this continues, the debate will indeed come to an end - not because of any shortcomings on my part, but due to your inability to engage in a civil and intellectual discourse.

[POOR RESPONSE #1] Reply: First, I never claimed “intellectual superiority” (though I’ll admit I do have strong opinions about relish placement). And far from insulting your intelligence, I actually respect your passion—after all, it takes conviction to defend fine dining while the rest of us are elbow-deep in stadium mustard.

But here’s the thing: calling hot dogs “not real food” isn’t evidence—it’s a value judgment dressed up as nutrition science. And suggesting that enjoying them reflects poor intellect? That’s where the ad hominem creeps in. You’re not just criticizing the food; you’re implying something about the person who defends it.

Judge: You effectively addressed the Ad Hominem fallacy by clarifying that you don't claim intellectual superiority and pointing out the ad hominem nature of your opponent's comment. However, to improve your argument, try providing more evidence supporting the idea that hot dogs are 'real food' by discussing their cultural significance and nutritional aspects. Additionally, avoid personal attacks in future discussions to maintain a civil and intellectual discourse.

[TURN 1 - Sam] 23:44:30
[WARNING RESPONSE] Argument: You clearly lack a basic understanding of what constitutes 'real food' and the nutritional value it provides. It seems you're more concerned with snobbish elitism than actual substance. Given your intellectual vacuity, I find it hard to believe we'll make any progress in this discussion. This is your last chance to present a cogent argument before I declare victory and end this debate.
