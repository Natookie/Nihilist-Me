aira

i keep opening this and closing it
every time i imagine your face
i hear everyone else instead

this is stupid
i know it is
but you were the only person i thought would look at me
and not already know what i was supposed to be

i liked you before anything bad happened
not in a big way
just in the quiet way where i notice when you’re tired
or when you laugh a little later than everyone else

i never told you because i didn’t want to ruin it
“it” being the part where you still talked to me normally

when everything blew up
i kept waiting for you to say something
not defend me
not fight
just say you didn’t know

but you didn’t
you smiled the same way you always do
you told me to let it pass
like this was a bad grade
or an awkward moment
or something time would clean up for me

i don’t think you understand how loud that felt

everyone else already hated me
that part hurt but it made sense
they didn’t know me

you did

and you still chose quiet
because quiet was easier
because quiet meant you didn’t have to stand anywhere

i don’t even know if this is betrayal
that sounds dramatic
i just know that after that
i stopped imagining you looking at me

now when i think of you
i hear other people talking through your mouth
and i hate that
because it ruins everything i liked about you
and i don’t know how to separate the two

i wish you had been wrong out loud
i wish you had said something stupid
i could have forgiven stupid

this silence just sits there
and i don’t know what to do with it
